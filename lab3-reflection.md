# Lab 3 – AWS Cloud Security Reflection
In this lab, I configured a basic AWS environment while applying foundational cloud security controls inspired by the lessons learned from the Capital One data breach. The goal was not just to launch services, but to implement security best practices around identity management, storage, compute, and monitoring. This lab demonstrated how cloud security failures often result from misconfiguration and weak governance rather than flaws in the cloud itself.

For Identity and Access Management (IAM), I created a separate IAM user and group instead of continuing to use the root account. The IAM user was assigned restricted permissions that allowed access only to the services necessary for the lab. This demonstrates the principle of least privilege, which limits users to only the permissions required to perform their tasks. In the Capital One breach, the attacker was able to access temporary credentials through the EC2 metadata service and then pivot into S3 because the IAM role attached to the instance had overly broad permissions. If stricter least-privilege policies had been enforced, the attacker’s ability to access sensitive data would have been significantly reduced. Creating a limited IAM user instead of relying on root access reinforced how reducing permissions lowers the potential blast radius of a compromised account.

For S3 storage, I created a bucket with “Block all public access” enabled and reviewed the bucket’s permissions settings. This step is critical because misconfigured S3 buckets are one of the most common causes of data leaks in cloud environments. In the Capital One case, although the data was not publicly exposed through an open bucket, overly permissive configurations still allowed the attacker to retrieve large amounts of sensitive information. Blocking public access and regularly reviewing bucket policies help ensure that data is not unintentionally exposed. This lab made it clear how easy it would be to accidentally leave a bucket open if security settings are ignored.

When launching an EC2 instance, I carefully configured the security group to allow SSH access only from my specific IP address instead of allowing open access from 0.0.0.0/0. Restricting inbound traffic minimizes the attack surface and prevents unauthorized connection attempts. In the Capital One breach, the attacker exploited a misconfigured web application firewall (WAF) and used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access the EC2 metadata service. While my lab did not involve a WAF, limiting network exposure and being aware of metadata service configurations (such as IMDSv2) directly relates to preventing similar exploitation paths. This step reinforced how network rules and instance settings play a major role in preventing lateral movement within cloud environments.

For monitoring and visibility, I reviewed the Billing Dashboard and attempted to access CloudTrail. My IAM lab user did not have permission to fully view billing data or CloudTrail event history, which demonstrated least privilege in action. Although this restricted access, it reflects good security design because sensitive financial and audit logs should only be accessible to specific roles. CloudTrail is especially important because it logs API activity and configuration changes. In the Capital One incident, weak detection controls allowed the attacker to operate for an extended period without immediate discovery. Continuous monitoring through services like CloudTrail, AWS Config, and billing alerts can significantly shorten the “window of opportunity” for attackers by detecting unusual behavior or unexpected costs.

One of the biggest lessons from this lab is how easy it is to create cloud resources, but how equally easy it is to misconfigure them. AWS provides strong security tools, but they must be intentionally configured and continuously monitored. Organizational culture and governance play a major role in determining whether these controls are consistently enforced. The Capital One breach illustrates that having cloud security tools available is not enough—organizations must actively apply least privilege, restrict network exposure, monitor activity, and regularly review configurations.

Overall, this lab demonstrated how IAM, S3, EC2, and monitoring services work together to build a secure cloud foundation. It reinforced that cloud security is not about avoiding the cloud, but about properly configuring and governing it. By applying these foundational controls, the likelihood and impact of incidents like the Capital One breach can be significantly reduced.
