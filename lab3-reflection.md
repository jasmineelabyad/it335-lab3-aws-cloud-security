Lab 3 – AWS Cloud Security Reflection

In this lab, I set up a basic AWS environment and practiced securing it using IAM, S3, EC2, and monitoring tools. The main goal was to learn how cloud security works in real life and to understand how mistakes like the Capital One breach happen. This lab showed me that the cloud itself is not the problem most issues come from misconfiguration and lack of monitoring.

For IAM, I created a separate IAM user and group instead of continuing to use the root account. I gave the user limited permissions so it could only access what was needed for the lab. This helped me understand least privilege, which means users should only have access to what they actually need. During the Capital One breach, the attacker was able to access sensitive data because the IAM role connected to the EC2 instance had too many permissions. If stricter permissions had been in place, the damage would have been much smaller. Creating a limited IAM user showed me how important it is to avoid using root and to keep permissions tight.

For S3, I created a bucket and made sure Block Public Access was turned on. I also checked the permissions tab to confirm nothing was public. This part stood out because it would be really easy to accidentally leave something open if you are not paying attention. Even though Capital One’s breach was not caused by a public bucket, weak access controls still allowed data to be taken once the attacker got inside. Blocking public access and reviewing bucket policies helps prevent large data leaks.

I also launched a Free Tier EC2 instance and configured the security group so SSH was only allowed from my own IP address. I avoided using 0.0.0.0/0. This reduces the attack surface and makes it harder for outsiders to connect. In the Capital One case, the attacker used SSRF to access the EC2 metadata service and steal credentials. While I did not set up a WAF in this lab, limiting inbound traffic and being aware of IMDS settings shows how network rules and instance configuration matter a lot for security.

For monitoring and billing, I reviewed the Billing Dashboard and tried accessing CloudTrail. My IAM user did not have full permissions, which caused “Access Denied” messages, but this actually demonstrated least privilege in action. CloudTrail logs activity and helps track changes in AWS accounts. One of the big problems in the Capital One breach was that the attacker went unnoticed for a long time. Tools like CloudTrail, AWS Config, and billing alerts help catch suspicious behavior sooner and reduce how long attackers can stay hidden.

Some parts of the lab felt easy, like creating resources and organizing screenshots. What felt confusing was permissions — it was easy to lock myself out or get access denied. That made me realize how simple it is to misconfigure cloud services if you are not careful.

This lab also showed that security is not just about tools. Organizational culture matters. Companies have to actually enforce security rules, review permissions, and monitor activity regularly. Capital One had security tools available, but failures in governance allowed the breach to happen.

Overall, this lab helped me understand how IAM, S3, EC2, and monitoring work together to protect cloud environments. It made it clear that cloud security depends on how systems are configured and managed. By using least privilege, blocking public access, limiting network exposure, and monitoring activity, organizations can greatly reduce the risk and impact of attacks like the Capital One breach.
